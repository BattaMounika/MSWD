<p><strong>Google Chrome </strong>is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla 
Firefox.[12] It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android where it is the default browser built into the OS.[13] The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the 
platform for web applications.

Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.[11] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google
 eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;[14] all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.[15]

As of March 2021, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 66% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[16] is also dominant on mobile,
 and has caught up with Safari on tablets (or about a percent-point below at 42.33%),[17][18] and at 63.59% across all platforms combined.[19] Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome"
 brand name to other products: Chrome OS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.</p>
